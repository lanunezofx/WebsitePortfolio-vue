    <p>A workspace is where you discover, formulate, investigate, or create something you work with. Sometimes a workspace may feel small, exhausting to look at, and suffocating. Well, it's not just sometimes, as mostly it would be. But do not let it be the reason to kill the flame of your burning passion. </p>
